# Lensless imaging
This is a repository accompanying a research project on Lensless imaging methods. The project was assigned as a part of a master's study programme in Numerical Physics at FNSPE CTU. 

#### _Main practical goals of the project:_ 
- _simulate numerical solutions to the diffraction problem and the paraxial approximations_
- _evaluate the deviation of paraxial approximations for changing Fresnel number_
- _implement Hybrid Input-Output reconstruction algoritm for CDI imaging_
- _add shrinkwrap support updates_
- _introduce noise and a specific dynamic range to the diffraction pattern_
